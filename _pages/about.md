I am a **Data Scientist** with a strong background in Mathematics, especially in Statistics.

I acquired **theoretical experience** while getting my Bachelor's in Mathematics and Master's in Artificial Intelligence.

I acquired **practical experience** while working as a Data Analyst with independent customers, academic researchers and established companies.

I have assisted customers with each step of the data workflow:

- **Data Acquisition & Cleaning**
- **Data exploration & Visualization**, including interactive dashboards
- **Machine Learning Modelisation & Serialization**

My previous customers noted my ability to work efficiently, independentely as well as collaboratively. My priority is always to meet your requirements, while maintaining a heavy collaboration.
